**[[Anglo Maratha War]]**
The Internal struggle for power between Maratha's made it easy for [[British]] to interfere in their affairs.

Peshwa Sawai Madhav Rao (supported by Nana Phadnavis) and Ex-Peshwa Raghunath Rao (supported by British) were the main factions, the British marched from [[Calcutta]] to [[Ahmedabad]] winning battles but eventually ended with the [[Treaty of Salbai]] in 1782(CoFFiN)

Peace was restored with the treaty, [[British]] managed to regain the lost territories from [[Haider Ali]] by making the Marathas exert pressure on [[Mysore]] Isolating the state of Mysore, which turned the tide in favour of British which led to the [[Third Anglo Mysore War]]
